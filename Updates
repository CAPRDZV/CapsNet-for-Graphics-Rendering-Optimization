- 2/11: Fuck it I'm writing my own neural net API

- 1/30 update: Got my computer running again, now I can start coding. I haven't found any major changes I need to make in my plans yet, 
but we'll see what actually ends up working. A few people in the industry have offered much appreciated help and advice, just need to 
collect a few more code samples. Also, here's a ton of semi-relevant readings I just uploaded and will be adding to, stuff that really 
exercised my brain for doing this kind of work: https://github.com/moothyknight/BRAIN-OVERLOAD

I also recommend 2 Minute Papers and Siraj Raval for crash courses in modern simulations and neural nets.
